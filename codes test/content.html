        They never want to miss a moment with their kids, but also feel the pressure to be present at work. Getting updates throughout the day makes working moms feel more connected to their kids, and Messenger Kids, a
        new app available in the US for iOS, Android and Fire tablets, is making it easier for working moms and their
        kids to talk.
        <br><br>
        Messenger Kids puts the power to communicate in the hands of children and lets them reach out to mom whenever
        they need to.
        <br><br>
        "After talking to thousands of moms and working with the Working Mother Research Institute, we've found that 84
        percent of moms wish they could have a brief look into how their child's day is going. Most feel there's a need
        for apps that let kids connect with people they love, but also have the level of parental control parents want,"
        says Antigone Davis, Facebook Global Head of Safety.

        Communication apps such as Messenger Kids have many benefits, including:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Connection. Apps are a great way for children to connect with the people they love. With Messenger
                Kids, kids
                can video chat and message with parent-approved contacts once their account is set up by a parent or
                guardian.</li>

            <li>
                Creativity. An app should be fun and allow kids to express themselves within the limits set by
                parents.
                Messenger Kids features a library of specially chosen GIFs, frames, stickers, masks and drawing tools
                that let
                them decorate photos and videos and have more fun with video chats.</li>

            <li>
                Control. Messenger Kids helps ease parents' concerns about how children are using devices and whether
                they are
                using apps that are age-appropriate. It also gives parents more control. Parents fully control the
                contact list
                and kids can't connect with people that their parent does not approve.</li>

            <li>
                Convenience. Apps, especially those built for kids, must be easy to set up and use. Once the account
                is
                established, the home screen shows kids at a glance whom they are approved to talk to and when those
                contacts
                are online. In addition, parents can chat with kids through their regular Messenger account, so it's
                convenient
                for both parent and child.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This Mother's Day, and every day with Messenger Kids, moms never have to miss a moment.
